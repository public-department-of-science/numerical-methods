Hello there!

My name is Bohdan Skrypka. I'm a Software \ Science engineer.

This block of information will be about science things I worked on. Some of my investigations and works 
you can find here mapped by folders (directions):
- numerical-methods: splines and interpolation techniques

=============================
Warning: If you not don't know what the difference between approximation and interpolation - please, stop reading right here,
 that's the simples thing you will read about down below!

If you're looking for something - you'll find that, just take your time.
I'm just kidding, if you want to know smth new from these folders - please, enjoy your reading here.
=============================

2) numerical-methods; approximation-methods:

Here is my favourite place from where I have been initially started my science path in 2015 - splines:
	It's great family of algorithms to approximate your function view by points.

- My favourite spline - is Akima's spline which one can help you to deal with unexpected 'jumping' points on your graph by 5-point prediction and smoothing your results.
- In the folder you can find program-code and some basic theory for Akima's and for another splines possible you will want to use.
